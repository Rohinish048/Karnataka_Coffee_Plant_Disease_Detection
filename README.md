The health of coffee plants is crucial for sustaining global coffee production, making early disease detection a vital aspect of agricultural management. By employing cutting-edge technologies, we can significantly enhance the accuracy of disease identification and prevention strategies, ultimately improving crop yield and quality. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as transformative solutions in this space, offering unparalleled precision in analyzing plant health.

For my project, I focused on classifying coffee plant diseases using image-based data. By leveraging a dataset of coffee plant images, I developed a robust pipeline for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The implementation was carried out in Python, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, with the project structured in a Jupyter Notebook.

The workflow began with loading the dataset, which was carefully partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets to ensure reliable performance metrics. A variety of deep learning architectures were explored, emphasizing the importance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. Key aspects of the project included:

1. Preprocessing images for consistency in size and format.
2. Implementing a pipeline to split the dataset for optimal training.
3. Training models with hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy.
4. Visualizing results to understand model performance and highlight areas for improvement.

This comprehensive approach provided insights into the effectiveness of ML models in identifying coffee plant diseases, showcasing how technological advancements can transform agricultural practices. The results underscored the potential of ML in revolutionizing disease management, ensuring healthier crops and more sustainable farming solutions.
